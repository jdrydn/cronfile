#Â Cronfile

A rather elegant solution to running cron jobs in Node.

```sh
$ npm install --save cronfile
```

**Note:** This is for the new `cronfile`, which is now an in-memory cron-like execution service. For the older version
of `cronfile`, which requires you to execute a script every minute using a pre-existing crontab,
[see 1.0.0 here](https://github.com/jdrydn/cronfile/tree/1.0.0).

## Why

Every single time we're writing a cron script for our app, it always looks something like this:

```
*/1 * * * * /usr/bin/node ~/project/scripts/crons/some_action.js
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/node ~/project/scripts/crons/some_other_action.js
*/20 * * * * /usr/bin/node ~/project/scripts/crons/yet_another_action.js
```

Where the files all look something like:

```js
var execute = function (callback) {
  do_some_action({ flush_cache: true }, callback);
};

execute(function (err) {
  if (err) console.error(err.toString());
  process.exit(err ? 1 : 0);
});
```

And that repeats for several files? Yuck. No.

Since most, if not all, of the cron jobs I run on a per-project basis are the same language, Javascript, here is a
simplified way to write the cron jobs as part of your codebase, checking them into a repository and managing them
through whichever deployment process you are comfortable with!

## Usage

In it's simplest usage:

```js
var cron = require('cronfile');

cron.on('*/1 * * * *', function () {
  console.log('Executing this function every minute!');
});

cron.on('*/15 * * * *', function (callback) {
  console.log('Executing this function every fifteen minutes!');
  callback();
});

cron.on('*/20 * * * *', function (callback) {
  console.log('Executing this function every twenty minutes!');
  callback(new Error('It failed, for some reason ðŸ˜¢'));
});
```

Next, grab your friendly neighbourhood production environment ([PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2),
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)) and run the cronfile:

```sh
$ npm install -g cronfile
# Assuming the above example is at cron.js
$ cronfile ./cron.js
```

Although keep reading, if you're not a fan of emails then you can send the error somewhere else,
[to Slack for instance](#cronrun)

##Â Events

`cronfile` now supports true events powered by an event emitter, so you can hook into various events that are emitted
throughout the life cycle.

### Started

When `cronfile` starts, it loads the crons and waits for the next minute to start before. The `started` event emits
when it's waiting, and includes the time it's waiting for.

```js
cron.on('started', function (wait_time) {
  console.log('Waiting for', wait_time); // Waiting for 10s
});
```

### Error

When the `cronfile` errors, either internally or from one of your cron functions, you can handle them using the `error`
event. The listener will be sent the error & if this came from a cron function then the date object that triggered the
function will also be passed:

```js
cron.on('error', function (err, time) {
  if (!time) console.error('Internal error:', err);
  else console.error('Cron error:', time.toString(), err);
});
```

### Tick

Every minute the cronfile executes, it emits a `tick` event passing the time & the number of functions that matched the
time.

```js
cron.on('tick', function (time, count) {
  console.log('%s x%d', time.toString(), count);
});
```

Ideal for monitoring your `cronfile` & ensuring it's executing on a minute basis.

## Aliases

You can attach events to times based on human-readable aliases rather than cron-timestamps, as defined in the
[`aliases.json`](./lib/aliases.json) file, so the above example could actually look like:

```js
var cron = require('cronfile');

cron.on('every_minute', function () {
  console.log('Executing this function every minute!');
});

cron.on('every_fifteen_minutes', function () {
  console.log('Executing this function every fifteen minutes!');
});

cron.on('every_twenty_minutes', function () {
  console.log('Executing this function every twenty minutes!');
});
```

You can also add your own aliases using `cron.aliases`:

```js
cron.aliases({
  '* 2 * * *': '2AM',
  '* */5 * * *': [ 'every_five_hours', 'five_hours' ],
});
```

This function takes an object where each object key is a valid cron timestamp and the value is a string (or an array
of strings (for multiple aliases to the same timestamp)) of the alias in question. It can be anything you want, but
you must keep it unique (otherwise you'll start overwriting aliases and have unexpected side-effects!)
